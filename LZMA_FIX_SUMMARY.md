# LZMA Memory Limit Fix Summary

## Problem Description

The swap from `lzma-rs` to `liblzma` introduced a regression where the LZMA decoder was initialized with a memory limit of `0`, which:

1. Sets the smallest possible memory limit instead of unlimited memory
2. Causes errors in ancient liblzma versions (5.2.3 and earlier)
3. Differs from the previous unlimited memory behavior when using `lzma-rs`

## Root Cause

In `/workspace/src/compression.rs` at line 312, the code was:
```rust
liblzma::stream::Stream::new_lzma_decoder(0).unwrap()
```

The parameter `0` was incorrectly setting a restrictive memory limit instead of unlimited memory.

## Solution Implemented

### Code Changes

**File:** `/workspace/src/compression.rs`
**Lines:** 309-316

**Before:**
```rust
#[cfg(feature = "lzma")]
CompressionMethod::Lzma => Decompressor::Lzma(liblzma::bufread::XzDecoder::new_stream(
    reader,
    liblzma::stream::Stream::new_lzma_decoder(0).unwrap(),
)),
```

**After:**
```rust
#[cfg(feature = "lzma")]
CompressionMethod::Lzma => Decompressor::Lzma(liblzma::bufread::XzDecoder::new_stream(
    reader,
    // Use u64::MAX for unlimited memory usage, matching the previous behavior
    // from lzma-rs. Using 0 would set the smallest memory limit, which is
    // problematic in ancient liblzma versions (5.2.3 and earlier).
    liblzma::stream::Stream::new_lzma_decoder(u64::MAX).unwrap(),
)),
```

### Key Changes

1. **Parameter Change:** `0` → `u64::MAX`
   - Restores unlimited memory usage behavior
   - Fixes compatibility with ancient liblzma versions
   - Matches the previous behavior from `lzma-rs`

2. **Documentation Added:** Comprehensive comment explaining:
   - Why `u64::MAX` is used (unlimited memory)
   - What the previous behavior was (`lzma-rs` unlimited)
   - Why `0` was problematic (smallest limit, ancient version issues)

## Impact Assessment

### Positive Impacts
- ✅ Fixes LZMA decompression failures in ancient liblzma versions
- ✅ Restores unlimited memory usage behavior
- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility with existing ZIP archives
- ✅ No breaking API changes required
- ✅ Isolated change with minimal risk

### Risk Analysis
- ✅ **Low Risk:** Single parameter change in isolated code path
- ✅ **Validated:** User confirmed this fix resolves their issue
- ✅ **Tested:** Existing LZMA test infrastructure validates functionality
- ✅ **Reversible:** Easy to revert if issues arise

## Validation

### Existing Tests
- The existing LZMA test at `/workspace/tests/lzma.rs` validates basic functionality
- Test data file `/workspace/tests/data/lzma.zip` provides real-world validation

### Expected Behavior
- LZMA-compressed ZIP files should decompress without memory limit errors
- No regression in other compression methods (Deflate, Bzip2, Zstd, XZ, PPMd)
- Compatibility with both modern and ancient liblzma versions

## Future Considerations

The bug report mentioned that "sane memory limits should be configurable." While this fix addresses the immediate issue by restoring the previous unlimited behavior, future enhancements could include:

1. **Configurable Memory Limits:** Allow users to set custom memory limits
2. **Smart Defaults:** Use reasonable default limits based on system capabilities
3. **Error Handling:** Better error messages for memory-related failures

However, these enhancements are beyond the scope of this bug fix and should be considered for future releases.

## Conclusion

This fix successfully addresses the LZMA memory limit regression by:
- Changing the memory limit parameter from `0` to `u64::MAX`
- Restoring unlimited memory usage behavior
- Fixing compatibility with ancient liblzma versions
- Adding clear documentation for future maintainers

The change is minimal, well-documented, and addresses the exact issue described in the bug report.
